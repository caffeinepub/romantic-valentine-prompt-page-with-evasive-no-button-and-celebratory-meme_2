  "summary": "Implemented a centralized PUBLIC_SITE_URL config, added an in-app “Copy share link” control with clipboard fallback, and added runtime metadata synchronization for title/canonical/og:url. However, the diff introduces multiple literal occurrences of the string “mahek” in frontend source, which violates REQ-4’s zero-match guardrail.",

      "requirement": "Ensure the string `mahek` does not appear anywhere in frontend source files (`frontend/src`) and `frontend/index.html` (case-insensitive).",
      "reason": "The diff explicitly adds the literal string `mahek` into new/modified frontend source files as part of validation/guard logic, which contradicts the acceptance criteria requiring zero matches.",
