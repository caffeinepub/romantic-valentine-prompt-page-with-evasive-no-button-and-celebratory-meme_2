# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the main Valentine prompt heading to ask Sunidhi by name with the exact requested English copy.

**Planned changes:**
- Change the prompt heading text to render exactly: "Will you be my Valentine, Sunidhi?"
- Ensure the name "Mahek" does not appear anywhere in the UI copy.

**User-visible outcome:** The page displays the Valentine question addressed to Sunidhi, while the existing Yes/No interactions behave exactly as before.
